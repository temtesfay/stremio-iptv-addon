## Testing your Add-on

To test your add-on, you will need to add the add-on manifest URL to a client.

There are currently two such clients that you can test with:

- Stremio v4.4.10+

- Stremio Web Version

**Note:** if you want to load an add-on by URL in Stremio, the URL must either have `127.0.0.1` as it's host or support HTTPS.

### Testing in Stremio App

Testing in Stremio is easy, simply [download Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/downloads) v4.4.10+ (latest beta from the site)


### Testing in Stremio Web Version

Open the web version of Stremio at: https://app.strem.io/shell-v4.4/

**Note: Torrents will not work in Stremio's Web Version.**
